This can happen when a repository was fetched via one VCS (e.g. Git), but contains metadata for another VCS (e.g. Mercurial). Modules which are retrieved using the go command line, i.e. via \"go get\", are not affected.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"toolchain","ecosystem":"Go"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.23.11"},{"introduced":"1.24.0-0"},{"fixed":"1.24.5"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"imports":[{"path":"cmd/go"}]}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://go.dev/cl/686515"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://go.dev/issue/74380"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/gTNJnDXmn34"}],"credits":[{"name":"RyotaK (https://ryotak.net) of GMO Flatt Security Inc"}],"database_specific":{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3828","review_status":"REVIEWED"}}
