This can be dangerous in certain cases, such as when dumping memory state, or assuming the status of standard i/o file descriptors.\n\nIf a setuid/setgid binary is executed with standard I/O file descriptors closed, opening any files can result in unexpected content being read or written with elevated privileges. Similarly, if a setuid/setgid program is terminated, either via panic or signal, it may leak the contents of its registers.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"stdlib","ecosystem":"Go"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.19.10"},{"introduced":"1.20.0-0"},{"fixed":"1.20.5"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"imports":[{"path":"runtime"}]}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://go.dev/issue/60272"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://go.dev/cl/501223"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/q5135a9d924/m/j0ZoAJOHAwAJ"}],"credits":[{"name":"Vincent Dehors from Synacktiv"}],"database_specific":{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1840","review_status":"REVIEWED"}}
