This requires the attacker to have pull and push permissions for the signature in OCI. This can happen with both standard signing with a keypair and \"keyless signing\" with Fulcio certificate authority.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/sigstore/cosign","ecosystem":"Go"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.5.2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"imports":[{"path":"github.com/sigstore/cosign/pkg/cosign","symbols":["VerifyBundle","VerifyImageAttestations","VerifyImageSignature","VerifyImageSignatures","VerifyLocalImageAttestations","VerifyLocalImageSignatures"]},{"path":"github.com/sigstore/cosign/pkg/sget","symbols":["SecureGet.Do"]},{"path":"github.com/sigstore/cosign/cmd/cosign/cli/verify","symbols":["PrintVerificationHeader","VerifyAttestationCommand.Exec","VerifyCommand.Exec"]}]}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/commit/96d410a6580e4e81d24d112a0855c70ca3fb5b49"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/releases/tag/v1.5.2"}],"database_specific":{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2022-0326","review_status":"REVIEWED"}}
