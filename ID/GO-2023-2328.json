The call to sync.Pool.Get will then return a bytes.Buffer that hasn't had bytes.Buffer.Reset called on it. This dirty buffer will contain the HTTP request body from an unrelated request, and go-resty will append the current HTTP request body to it, sending two bodies in one request.\n\nThe sync.Pool in question is defined at package level scope, so a completely unrelated server could receive the request body.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/go-resty/resty/v2","ecosystem":"Go"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"2.10.0"},{"fixed":"2.11.0"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"imports":[{"path":"github.com/go-resty/resty/v2","symbols":["Backoff","Request.Delete","Request.Execute","Request.Get","Request.Head","Request.Options","Request.Patch","Request.Post","Request.Put","Request.Send","handleRequestBody"]}]}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/go-resty/resty/issues/743"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/go-resty/resty/issues/739"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/go-resty/resty/pull/745"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/go-resty/resty/commit/577fed8730d79f583eb48dfc81674164e1fc471e"}],"credits":[{"name":"Logan Attwood (@lattwood)"}],"database_specific":{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-2328","review_status":"REVIEWED"}}
