This mismatch can cause the evidence to be invalid, upon which the node producing the evidence will be asked to generate a new evidence. This new evidence will be the same, which means it will again be rejected by other nodes involved in the consensus. This loop will continue until the peer nodes decide to disconnect from the node producing the evidence.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/tendermint/tendermint","ecosystem":"Go"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.34.0"},{"fixed":"0.34.3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"imports":[{"path":"github.com/tendermint/tendermint/evidence","symbols":["Pool.CheckEvidence","Pool.Update"]},{"path":"github.com/tendermint/tendermint/consensus","symbols":["BaseWAL.OnStart","Handshaker.Handshake","Handshaker.ReplayBlocks","Reactor.OnStart","Reactor.SwitchToConsensus","RunReplayFile","State.OnStart","State.OpenWAL","State.ReplayFile","State.tryAddVote","WALGenerateNBlocks","WALWithNBlocks"]}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/security/advisories/GHSA-p658-8693-mhvg"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/v0.34.3/CHANGELOG.md#v0.34.3"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/commit/a2a6852ab99e4a0f9e79f0ea8c1726e262e25c76"}],"credits":[{"name":"cmwaters (Github)"}],"database_specific":{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2022-1052","review_status":"REVIEWED"}}
