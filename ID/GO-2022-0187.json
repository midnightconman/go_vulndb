An adaptive attack can progressively extract the scalar input to ScalarMult by submitting crafted points and observing failures to derive correct output. This leads to a full key recovery attack against static ECDH, as used in popular JWT libraries.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"stdlib","ecosystem":"Go"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"1.6.0-0"},{"fixed":"1.7.6"},{"introduced":"1.8.0-0"},{"fixed":"1.8.2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"imports":[{"path":"crypto/elliptic","goarch":["amd64"],"symbols":["p256SubInternal"]}]}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://go.dev/cl/41070"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/9294fa2749ffee7edbbb817a0ef9fe633136fa9c"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://go.dev/issue/20040"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/B5ww0iFt1_Q/m/TgUFJV14BgAJ"}],"credits":[{"name":"Vlad Krasnov"},{"name":"Filippo Valsorda at Cloudflare"}],"database_specific":{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2022-0187","review_status":"REVIEWED"}}
