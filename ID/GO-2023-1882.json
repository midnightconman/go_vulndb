The first is via logs, by setting the consensus logging module to \"debug\" level (which should not happen in production), and setting the log output format to JSON. The second is via RPC dump_consensus_state.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/cometbft/cometbft","ecosystem":"Go"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.37.1"},{"fixed":"0.37.2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"imports":[{"path":"github.com/cometbft/cometbft/consensus","symbols":["PeerState.MarshalJSON"]}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/security/advisories/GHSA-mvj3-qrqh-cjvr"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/524"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/863"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/865"}],"database_specific":{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1882","review_status":"REVIEWED"}}
