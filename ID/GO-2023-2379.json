This parameter dictates the number of PBKDF2 iterations needed to derive a CEK wrapping key. Its purpose is to intentionally slow down the key derivation function, making password brute-force and dictionary attacks more resource-intensive. However, if an attacker sets the p2c parameter in JWE to a very large number, it can cause excessive computational consumption.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx","ecosystem":"Go"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.2.27"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"imports":[{"path":"github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/jwe","symbols":["Decrypt"]}]}},{"package":{"name":"github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/v2","ecosystem":"Go"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.0.18"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"imports":[{"path":"github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/v2/jwe","symbols":["Decrypt","decryptCtx.decryptContent"]}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/security/advisories/GHSA-7f9x-gw85-8grf"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/commit/64f2a229b8e18605f47361d292b526bdc4aee01c"}],"credits":[{"name":"@P3ngu1nW"}],"database_specific":{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-2379","review_status":"REVIEWED"}}
