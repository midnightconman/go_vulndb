If these names are used without further sanitization, for instance unsafely included in HTML, they may allow for injection of unexpected content. Note that LookupTXT may still return arbitrary values that could require sanitization before further use.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"stdlib","ecosystem":"Go"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.15.13"},{"introduced":"1.16.0-0"},{"fixed":"1.16.5"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"imports":[{"path":"net","symbols":["Resolver.LookupAddr","Resolver.LookupCNAME","Resolver.LookupMX","Resolver.LookupNS","Resolver.LookupSRV"]}]}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://go.dev/cl/320949"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/c89f1224a544cde464fcb86e78ebb0cc97eedba2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/RgCMkAEQjSI"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://go.dev/issue/46241"}],"credits":[{"name":"Philipp Jeitner"},{"name":"Haya Shulman from Fraunhofer SIT"}],"database_specific":{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2021-0239","review_status":"REVIEWED"}}
