This may cause the template parser to improperly consider script contexts to be terminated early, causing actions to be improperly escaped. This could be leveraged to perform an XSS attack.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"stdlib","ecosystem":"Go"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.20.8"},{"introduced":"1.21.0-0"},{"fixed":"1.21.1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"imports":[{"path":"html/template","symbols":["Template.Execute","Template.ExecuteTemplate","escaper.escapeText","indexTagEnd","tSpecialTagEnd"]}]}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://go.dev/issue/62197"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://go.dev/cl/526157"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://groups.google.com/g/golang-dev/c/2C5vbR-UNkI/m/L1hdrPhfBAAJ"}],"credits":[{"name":"Takeshi Kaneko (GMO Cybersecurity by Ierae, Inc.)"}],"database_specific":{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-2043","review_status":"REVIEWED"}}
