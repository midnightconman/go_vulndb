This can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution. When performing a Git operation, the library will try to clone the given repository to a specified destination. Cloning initializes a git config in the provided destination. An attacker may alter the Git config after the cloning step to set an arbitrary Git configuration to achieve code execution.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/hashicorp/go-getter","ecosystem":"Go"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.7.5"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"imports":[{"path":"github.com/hashicorp/go-getter","symbols":["Client.ChecksumFromFile","Client.Get","FolderStorage.Get","Get","GetAny","GetFile","GitGetter.Get","GitGetter.GetFile","GitGetter.clone","HttpGetter.Get","findRemoteDefaultBranch"]}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xfhp-jf8p-mh5w"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter/commit/268c11cae8cf0d9374783e06572679796abe9ce9"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/hcsec-2024-13-hashicorp-go-getter-vulnerable-to-code-execution-on-git-update-via-git-config-manipulation/68081"}],"database_specific":{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2948","review_status":"REVIEWED"}}
